  title: Common Questions?

    large: "assets/images/faq/05.jpg"
  questions:
    - question: "What is solar energy, and how does it work?"
      answer: "Solar energy harnesses sunlight through photovoltaic panels that convert light into electricity. These panels contain semiconductors that create an electric current when exposed to sunlight, providing clean, renewable power for homes and businesses."

    - question: "How much can I save with solar installation?"
      answer: "Savings vary based on energy consumption, local utility rates, and system size. Most homeowners save 20-30% on their electricity bills, with the system typically paying for itself within 5-7 years through reduced energy costs and government incentives."

    - question: "What maintenance do solar panels require?"
      answer: "Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Regular cleaning to remove dust and debris, annual professional inspections, and occasional monitoring of system performance are typically sufficient to maintain optimal operation."

    - question: "How long do solar panels last?"
      answer: "Quality solar panels have a lifespan of 25-30 years, with manufacturers typically providing 25-year performance warranties. While efficiency may slightly decrease over time, panels continue producing significant power well beyond their warranty period."

    - question: "Will solar panels work during power outages?"
      answer: "Standard grid-tied systems automatically shut off during power outages for safety reasons. However, systems with battery backup can continue providing power during outages, ensuring continuous electricity supply to your home."

    - question: "What happens on cloudy days or during winter?"
      answer: |
        Solar panels continue to generate electricity on cloudy days, although at a reduced efficiency (typically 20-30% of normal output). Modern solar panels are designed to function effectively in all seasons, including winter, although their energy production may be lower due to factors like reduced sunlight hours and weather conditions.

        To ensure a consistent power supply even during cloudy days or winter months when solar generation may be limited, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can be used to store excess energy generated on sunnier days. This stored energy can then be used when solar output is low, ensuring that your home or business has a reliable and stable power source year-round, regardless of weather conditions.


    - question: "Are there government incentives for solar installation?"
      answer: "Yes, numerous incentives are available, including federal tax credits, state rebates, and local utility programs. These can significantly reduce the initial installation costs, sometimes by up to 50% or more."
